  Lightweight tool for fast, repeatable performance benchmarking
</p>

--------

<p>The idea behind Powermonkey was to build a lightweight, open-source benchmark that’s simple, fast, and efficient. I didn’t want to download gigabytes of data just to run a test that measures one aspect of performance at a time. I wanted a straightforward tool that shows how well my system performs — especially in comparison to others.</p>

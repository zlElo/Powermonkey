  Lightweight tool for fast, repeatable performance benchmarking
</p>

--------

<p>The idea behind Powermonkey was to build a lightweight, open-source benchmark that’s simple, fast, and efficient. I didn’t want to download gigabytes of data just to run a test that measures one aspect of performance at a time. I wanted a straightforward tool that shows how well my system performs — especially in comparison to others.</p>

<p>BTW: Powermonkey uses 3rd party code as little a possible, even the logger is a small self-written class</p>


<h3>Measurements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    CPU test using a Pi approximation and a parallel prime number calculation algorithm
  </li>

  <li>
    GPU test based on the raw matrix-multiplication performance
  </li>
    
  <li>
    Disk test based on copy speed
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
coming soon...
